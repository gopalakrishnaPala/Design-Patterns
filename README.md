# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

# What does the pattern consist of?
- **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
- **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
- **Code example** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

# Classification of patterns
- **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
