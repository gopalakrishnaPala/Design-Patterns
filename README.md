# Design Patterns

**Christopher Alexander** says, "Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution
to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice"

#### In general, a pattern has four essential elements:

- The **pattern name** is a handle we can use to describe a design problem, its solutions, and consequences in a word or two.
- The **problem** describes when to apply the pattern. It explains the problem and its context
- The **solution** describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.
- The **consequences** are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern

### Classification of patterns
- **Creational patterns** abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created,composed, and represented.
- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

### Creational patterns
- **Factory Method** - provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created 
- **Abstract Factory** - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder** - lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
- **Prototype** - lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
- **Singleton** - lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
